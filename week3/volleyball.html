      <h2>Travel tournaments</h2>
      <h3>Austin</h3>
        <p>
          Typically our first travel tournament of the season is to Austin, TX. Some<br>
           of the best competition in the nation goes to this tournament and it is a <br>
           great way to start off the season along with some team bonding.

      <h3>Anaheim</h3>
        <p>
          Next in the season is the Anaheim, CA tournament. This one is also always <br>
          a blast. The Austin tournament is often like a warmup to see what the competition<br>
           is like, but Anaheim is closer to nationals and is a glimpse of how national will<br>
            be for the team.
        </p>
      <h3>St. Louis</h3>
        <p>
          The last tournament of the season is nationals. Every year the location for nationals<br>
           changes, but most recently it was in St. Louis, MO. This is where we put toegther<br>
            the whole seasons worth of work and where we play our best. At the end of the tournamnet<br>
             all the teams who didn't make it to the finals gather and cheer on the final games.<br>
             It is truly something to be a part of. Then of course the finals are followed by player <br>
             parties and fun.
