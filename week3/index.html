      <h1>The Shipwreck</h1>
      <p>Located on Lincoln Place and the corner of 9th and College sits what <br>
        seems like just an ordinary old Boulder house. To the people who have spent<br>
         their college years living there and to all the people who have been there it<br>
          is more than just a house. It is "The Shipwreck." Arguably the most iconic house<br>
          in Boulder. The last few years The Shipwreck has also been coined the <a href="volleyball.html">club<br>
            volleyball</a> house.

      <h3>The People</h3>
      <p>The most recent people of The Shipwreck were Logan, Hunter, Ashley,<br>
         Henry, Erica, Jordan, and Savannah. </p>
      <img src="assets/lognunchucks.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="Logan on his birthday where he wished for nunchucks"/>
      <p>Pictured above is Logan, who wished for nunchucks for his birthday. He<br>
         clearly got what he wished for and had an incredible 23rd birthday.</p>
      <img src="assets/jordankitchen.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="Jordan and Sav in kitchen"/>
      <p>These two are Jordan and Sav, who had  the attic rooms of the house.<br>
        While the attic was unbearably hot in the summers, these two absolutely loved<br>
        it, as the wooden walls reminded them of a cozy mountain cabin. Not to<br>
         mention, both rooms had incredible views of the iconic Boulder Flatirons.</p>
      <img src="assets/hhcandycorn.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="Hunter and Henry candy corn costume"/>
      <p>Here are Hunter and Henry. For Henry's birthday the house created a jenga<br>
         game with funny tasks to do on each of the blocks. One block was "put on<br>
         Sav's candy corn costume" and one was "sit in the lap of the person to your<br>
         right." So this photo is a result of both of those blocks being pulled.</p>
      <img src="assets/karaoke.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="Logan, Erica, and Sol singing karaoke"/>
      <p>In the middle is Erica. One of her favorite activities was using the karaoke <br>
        machine to sing Olivia Rodrigo, High School Musical, and One Direction. Fun<br>
        fact: one time during lockdown the cops came to the house because of karaoke<br>
        ... and it ended up just being three of the roommates singing alone. Oops.</p>

      <h3>Backyard Activities</h3>
      <p>The backyard of The Shipwreck was probably one of the largest backyards you <br>
        could find in Boulder. More space than known what to do with... but the <br>
        opportunities were endless and the tenants took advantage of that. During <br>
        the summer you could find them playing games during the day then projecting<br>
         movies up against the house at night. And in the winter they would find everything<br>
          they could to build a ramp to ski down.</p>
      <img src="assets/dietable.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="this is the die table"/>
      <p>This is the dye table they painted. Along with games like beersbee, volleyball,<br>
        ping pong, snowball fights, etc., dye was a fan favorite. they played rain, snow,<br>
      and shine. And it was extremely competitive.</p>
      <img src="assets/rampsnowday.jpg" style="width:30vw" alt="snow day ramp"/>
      <p>This is the ski/snowboard ramp they built ft. Logan building a snowman.<br>
        There would typically be a lot more snow to cover the sides and end of<br>
        the ramp, then a little jump right at the bottom. They would spend hours<br>
        skiing down.</p>
